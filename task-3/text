1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this.

=> Given the circumstances, my approach would be to prioritize Task 2 as it has a more pressing deadline. I would reach out to Manoj and Ravi and 
   inform them about the family emergency and the unavoidable delay in the completion of both tasks. I would explain to them that I will be asking 
   for an extension for Task 1 as it is of low priority and has not been given a go-live date by the customer.

2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
   approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
   Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.   

=> Subject: Update on Task Deliveries

   Dear Manoj and Ravi,

   I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a recent family emergency that has arisen, and the impact it will have on the 
   delivery of Tasks 1 and 2. Unfortunately, I will not be able to meet the original due date for either task for at least 3 more days.

   Given the circumstances, I have made the difficult decision to prioritize the delivery of Task 2, as it has a shorter deadline and is for a 
   priority customer. I have assessed the situation and I am confident that I can still meet the revised deadline for Task 2.

   However, I understand that this may cause inconvenience to the customer of Task 1, who has not provided a go-live date. I would like to request an 
   extension of the due date for Task 1, as it is of a lower priority.

   Please let me know if there are any further concerns or questions, and I would be happy to discuss this further with you.

   Best regards,
   Ayushi Jain

3. How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
   email to the customer informing them about this).
