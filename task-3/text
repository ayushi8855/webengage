1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this.

=> Given the circumstances, my approach would be to prioritize Task 2 as it has a more pressing deadline. I would reach out to Manoj and Ravi and 
   inform them about the family emergency and the unavoidable delay in the completion of both tasks. I would explain to them that I will be asking 
   for an extension for Task 1 as it is of low priority and has not been given a go-live date by the customer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
   approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
   Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.

 Dear [Customer's name],

 I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a recent family emergency that has arisen and I will not be able to meet the 
  original due date for Task 2.

 After careful consideration, I have decided to prioritize this task and allocate extra resources to complete it before the new deadline. I would 
 like to request an extension of 3 days for Task 2.

 I understand that this may cause inconvenience for you and I apologize for that. I assure you that we are doing everything in our power to 
 complete  Task 2 as soon as possible.

 Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist you.

 Best regards

   email to the customer informing them about this).
